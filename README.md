### OS_project_xv6
implementing different scheduling policies in XV6 operating system

 With the new operating system of XV6, I implemented some scheduling policies, such as Round-Robin, non-preemptive priority scheduling,
 preemptive, and dynamic multi-layered queued scheduling.
 
 ## Round-Robin
 
 Round Robin CPU Algorithm generally focuses on Time Sharing technique. 
The period of time for which a process or job is allowed to run in a pre-emptive method is called time quantum. 
Each process or job present in the ready queue is assigned the CPU for that time quantum, if the execution of the process is completed during that time
then the process will end else the process will go back to the waiting table and wait for the its next turn to complete the execution.
